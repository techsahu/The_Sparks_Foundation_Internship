Task 3: K-mean Clustring
    From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
    
Task 4: Decision Tree
    For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
    
Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis on Super Market dataset
    Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’.
